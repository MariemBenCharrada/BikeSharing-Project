# BikeSharing-Project
This project is part of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program powered by Bertelsmann

## Project Overview
In this project, I built a neural network and used it to predict daily bike rental ridership. The neural net is built from scratch and it was trained on a real time dataset.
